# Analog-clock-using-OpenCV

Computer vision project implemented with OpenCV

Here in this project we will use the concepts of Trigonometry and Computer Vision along with the capabilities of python to develop a analog running watch.

# Algorithm

1. Start the project by including dependencies.
2. Initialize the constants Radius, Canvas size, Colors.
3. Start drawing the watch
4. Develop function to get start and end positions of tick marks on watch.
5. Draw tick marks.
6. Develop function for movements and drawing of hands.
7. Draw hands.
8. Move hands to time angles.
9. Show the clock in loop.

Requirements: python3 , numpy , opencv installed on your system.
